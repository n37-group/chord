<h1>String unification</h1>
<p>
A string is just a list of characters.
An expression is a list of characters or variables.
The notation for a variable is just {{X}}.
So an expression looks like 'hello {{X}} world'.
</p>
<p>
The goal of this library is to unify two expressions. For example unifying 'boys and girls' and 'boys {{X}} girls'
has an obvious solution, X = 'and'.
</p>

<h2>The empty string</h2>
<p>The empty string, i.e. the empty list is unifiable</p>

<h2>Examples</h2>
<h3>Unifying 'hello' and 'hello'</h3>
<table style="width:100%">
    <tr>
        <th>Firstname</th>
        <th>Lastname</th>
        <th>Age</th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>Jill</td>
        <td>Smith</td>
        <td>50</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>Eve</td>
        <td>Jackson</td>
        <td>94</td>
    </tr>
</table>
